Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
ANS: Data structure is needed to storing and organizing information so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
ANS: Database Management System, Statistical analysis, Artificial intelligence
what is an Array?
ANS: Array is a container which hold a fixed number of values.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
ANS: Array is fixed length, after creating an array object cannot be change the array size. ArrayList is dynamic, its capacity grows automatically.
what is LinkedList?
ANS: In LinkedList every node have 2 part, data and reference to the next node.
what is queue?
ANS: Element inserted first will also be removed first. FIFO.
what is stack?
ANS: Element inserted last will be removed first which is LIFO
what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO -> First in First Out, LIFO -> Last in Last Out.
what is the order of complexity?
ANS:
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
ANS: Insertion
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
ANS: Merge
what is tree in data structure?
ANS: In data structure, tree represents nodes connected by edges
what is graph in data structure?
ANS:
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
ANS:
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
ANS: RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
     Network data model = Graph
     Hierarchical data model = Trees
How HashMap works in java?
ANS:
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ANS:
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
ANS: Use of API and implementing algorithm
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
ANS: Difficult to add or remove data from array, but in LinkedList data can be add/remove from anywhere.
What is DFS and BFS?
ANS:
What is Recursion?
ANS:
What is Big-(O)-notation?
ANS:
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
ANS:
Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
